# Electron Base Application
This is a template for a basic Electron application that has more of a traditional application look and feel. The default Electron window border, title bar, and menu bar have been hidden and recreated using html and css styling.

The Electron main script is essentially the "Hello World" electron script because the important part for this is the look and feel of the main application window.

This interface also allows for jQuery code to be used like normal even though it is required like a standard node package by using a shim javascript file.

Also, this template is built on top of the Bootstrap CSS framework.

All of the styling is done through [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) so the visual style of the application can be easily adjusted.
